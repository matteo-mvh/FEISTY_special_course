# FEISTY Special Course

**FEISTY_special_course** is a repository for exploring marine ecosystem dynamics using the **FEISTY model**. The repository is structured into two main components: **Local** and **Global**.

---

## Repository Structure

### 1. Local
The **Local** section focuses on **specific locations** to analyze theoretical concepts and potential outcomes.  
Key features include:  
- Targeted study areas such as **Shelf Sea**, **Slope**, and **Open Ocean**.  
- Exploration of different **fishing scenarios** and their effects on local ecosystems.  
- Useful for understanding dynamics at a smaller, controlled scale before scaling up globally.  

### 2. Global
The **Global** section runs the FEISTY model at a **global scale** to assess larger patterns and trends.  
Key features include:  
- Simulation across all ocean regions using **global forcing datasets**.  
- Investigation of total biomass, carbon fluxes, and ecosystem responses under various fishing scenarios.  
- Provides a broad picture of marine ecosystem dynamics and global impacts of fishing.

## Key Features

- Sequential and scalable **FEISTY simulations**.  
- Calculation of **fish biomass** and **carbon injection**.  
- Flexible setup to test multiple **fishing scenarios**.  
- Data output ready for **visualization** and **analysis**.
