Each grid cell has an estimate of the pelagic Tp (0-100m), 
mid-water Tm (500-1500m) and bottom temperature Tb, 
seafloor depth, euphotic depth (photic), small (szprod) and 
large zooplankton (lzprod) production and 
detrital flux reaching the seafloor (dfbot).

Input data is representative of the early 1990s.

Water temperature

The water column temperature (average temperature for 2005-2017) estimates are taken 
from the World Ocean Atlas 2018 at a 1¬∞ grid (Locarnini et al., 2018). 
The temperature estimates are used to derive a pelagic, mid-water and bottom temperature

Euphotic depth
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The euphotic depth is estimated using average daily surface chlorophyll a concentrations 
(mg chlorophyll a m‚Äì3 d‚Äì1) from the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor between 1998 and 
2008 (https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/seawifs/) and the relationships of Morel 
and Berthon (1989): ùëßeu=568.2 ¬∑ ùê∂tot^‚àí0.746 where Ctot, the total chlorophyll a content 
in the euphotic water column, is estimated from surface chlorophyll a 
concentrations (Csur) as ùê∂tot= 40.6 ¬∑ ùê∂sur^0.459.

Small and large zooplankton production

gfdl-ESM2.6-COBALT (Stock et al. 2014, 2017)

The parameterization of small and large zooplankton production is based on output of GFDL‚Äôs 
Carbon, Ocean Biogeochemistry and Lower Trophics (COBALT) ecosystem model from a climatology 
of the global earth system model (ESM2.6) representative of the early 1990s 
(Stock et al., 2014, 2017). The ESM2.6-COBALT model, which is described and evaluated in Stock et 
al. (2017), has an ocean resolution of 1/10¬∞. The output is coarsened to a 1¬∞ grid for use in this 
application. The COBALT model includes three different size groups of zooplankton: microzooplankton 
(< 200 Œºm), zooplankton representing small to medium sized copepods (0.2‚Äì2.0 mm) and zooplankton 
representing large copepods and krill (2.0‚Äì20 mm). Fish mainly eat the two larger size groups 
and mortality from predation by fish and other predators (not modeled within COBALT) is parameterized 
with a density dependent closure term. This closure term represents the loss of energy to higher 
predators in g C m-2 y-1, which we converted to g wet weight m-2 y-1 assuming a wet weight to carbon 
ratio of 9:1.

Fish larvae in FEISTY are unable to top-down control small zooplankton prey. As not much is eaten by the 
fish larvae, we assume that the maximum production of small zooplankton (r ¬∑ Rmax) at each grid cell 
equals the loss of small zooplankton to higher predators from the ESM2.6-COBALT model.

Such an assumption does not work for large zooplankton that are more top-down controlled by fish. 
For that reason, we use the ESM2.6-COBALT estimate of large zooplankton loss to predators at each 
grid cell to predict the ‚Äúmost likely‚Äù maximum zooplankton production (r ¬∑Rmax). 
To do this, we first estimate the ratio between maximum production and the loss of energy to 
fish predators in the fish model for different temperatures. We find that the average ratio 
between loss to fish predators and maximum production is 0.91 at 30¬∞C, 0.89 at 20¬∞C, 
0.85 at 10¬∞C and 0.78 at 0¬∞C. We afterwards estimate maximum large zooplankton 
production at each grid cell using the temperature-specific ratios, 
ESM2.6-COBALT output of large zooplankton loss to predators and ESM2.6-COBALT average temperature 
estimates of the first 100-meter water column.
